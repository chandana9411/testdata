Datascience :
========================

It is taking or extracting the actionable insights from raw data which helps the firms to maker necessary descisions
 and policies. this inturn helps in bussiness, research, finding cures and many more. 


What is a Data Scientist

=========================


Data scientists are big data wranglers, gathering and analyzing large sets of structured and unstructured data.
 A data scientist’s role combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics. 
They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and 
other organizations.

Data scientists are analytical experts who utilize their skills in both technology and social science to 
find trends and manage data. They use industry knowledge, contextual understanding, skepticism of existing 
assumptions – to uncover solutions to business challenges.

A data scientist’s work typically involves making sense of messy, unstructured data, 
from sources such as smart devices, social media feeds, and emails that don’t neatly fit into a database.




report structure:
======================================

the cover page should include the title of the report, names of authors, their affiliations and contacts,
 the name of the institutional publisher (if any) and the date of publication.from a business point of view, 
authors should make it easier for the reader to reach out to them. Having contact details at the front makes 
the task easier.

A table of contents (ToC)" is like a map needed for a trip never taken before. The ToC with main headings,
 lists of tables and figures offers a glimpse of what lies ahead in the document.
definetly include a ToC, especially if your document, excluding cover page, table of contents, and references,
 is five or more pages in length.

abstract" or an "executive summary". Nothing is more powerful than explaining the crux of your arguments in 
three paragraphs or less. for larger documents running a few hundred pages, the executive summary could be longer.
 An "introductory section" is always helpful in setting up the problem for the reader who might be new to the 
topic and who might need to be gently introduced to the subject matter before being immersed in intricate details. 



Next section is a ''review '' of available relevant research on the subject matter. The length of the " literature review "
section depends upon how contested the subject matter is. use the literature review to highlight gaps in the existing 
knowledge, which your analysis will try 
to fill. This is where you formally introduce your research questions and hypothesis.


In the "methodology" section, you introduce the research methods and data sources you used for the analysis. 
If you have collected new data, explain the data collection exercise in some detail. 


The results section is where you present your empirical findings. Starting with descriptive statistics and 
illustrative graphics you will move toward formally testing your hypothesis




The next is discussion section, where you craft your main arguments by building on the results you have presented earlier.
The "discussion section" is where you rely on the power of narrative to enable numbers to communicate your thesis 
to your readers. You refer the reader to the research question and the knowledge gaps you identified earlier.
 You highlight how your findings provide the ultimate missing piece to the puzzle.



In the "conclusion" section, you generalize your specific findings and take on a rather marketing approach to promote 
your findings so that the reader does not remain stuck....you might also identify future possible developments in research 
and applications that could result from your research. 


The last is including a list of references, the acknowledgment section (acknowledging the support of those who have
 enabled your work is always good) and "appendices", if needed.




checklist
-----------------------------------


the checklist is useful for budding data scientists and, therefore, I have reproduced it verbatim for their benefit.

Have you told readers, at the outset, what they might gain by reading your paper?

Have you made the aim of your work clear?

Have you explained the significance of your contribution?

Have you set your work in the appropriate context by giving sufficient background (including a complete set of relevant
 references) to your work?

Have you addressed the question of practicality and usefulness?

Have you identified future developments that might result from your work?

Have you structured your paper in a clear and logical fashion?
